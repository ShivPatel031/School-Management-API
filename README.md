# School-Management-API
Developed a secure, scalable REST API using Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL to manage school data, sort by proximity, and deployed on Railway with thorough Postman testing.

Here are four key points about your project:  

1. **Comprehensive API Features**  
   - Developed a REST API using Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL, enabling users to add school details (name, address, latitude, longitude) with robust validation for input types and ranges. Errors are provided for missing or invalid values.  
   - Included functionality to list schools nearest to a user's location, returning results sorted by proximity in ascending order.  

2. **Security and Data Validation**  
   - Implemented input validation for latitude and longitude as floating-point numbers and ensured they fall within valid geographical ranges.  
   - Integrated safeguards against invalid or incomplete data, ensuring API reliability and accuracy.  

3. **Deployment and Testing**  
   - Hosted the database on FreeSQLDatabase and deployed the API using Railway, ensuring easy access and scalability.  
   - Tested all routes extensively using Postman to verify functionality and error handling.  

4. **Learning and Solo Work**  
   - This was a solo project where you learned valuable skills in API development, deployment, and testing. The project enhanced your understanding of backend development and practical application of database hosting and deployment tools.
